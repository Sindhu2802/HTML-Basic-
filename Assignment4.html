        Hello! I'm <b>Sindhu C</b> from Tirunelveli. I have recently completed my 
        <b>Master's in Cyber Security</b> with a CGPA of 9 from 
        <b>Manonmaniam Sundaranar University</b>, and my

        <b>Sadakathullah Appa College, Tirunelveli</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am passionate about starting my career in the <b>banking sector</b>, 
        as I have a strong foundation in <b>cyber security and technology</b> 
        which aligns with digital transformation and security needs in banking. 
        During my internship at the <b>Cyber Crime Police Station, Tirunelveli</b>, 
        I gained practical exposure to applying security knowledge in real cases.

        My strengths are being a <b>quick learner</b>, 
        <b>highly motivated</b>, and <b>punctual</b>, 
        always giving my best to complete tasks on time. 
        I have technical skills in <b>Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript</b>, 
        and <b>PostgreSQL</b>. I have also solved 
        <b>75 coding problems on LeetCode</b>, which helped me
